## Summary
In the first tab, the users majority of user tend to use the bikes within the first hour but there are users that use bikes for hours. When looking at the second graph in the first tab, the majority of the users are males followed by female and unknown. Male users peak around 100 thousand users while females peak around 30 thousand users. The data points of the genders tend to merge together after the first hour. For the second slide, the heat map general stoptime has peak hours during the weekday between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. While the weekend has continuous general use between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. For the third slide, the genders follow the same peak hours as the second slide but males are more abundant like in the first slide. For the fourth slide in the heat map, there tends to be more use from the subscribers than the one time use Customers. The one time users are even with the use in gender but in the subscribers, there is high abundance in males over female and unknown. Both of these points are reflected in the both pie charts. For the bubble map chart, the abundance of top starting location is highest in the city than the outskits. There are still demand in the outskits but not as heavily in the downtown area.
